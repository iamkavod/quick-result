  briefHistory: `The idea of bringing people together for rapid growth started in 2004 and eight ladies started immediately. 

In 2008, the initiator of the idea relocated to Abuja, shared same idea with colleagues ensuring everyone saved or contributed out of their take home pay. 

1n 2014, the name Ladies Seal Multipurpose Cooperative was registered and put to use by these women who just wanted to empower each other . Because these women were impressed with the operation of the cooperative, they introduced their husbands and friends. This led to the use of Quick Result MPCS to embrace men and women respectively. 

In 2016, there was dire need to raise funds beyond the usual benchmark. The reality became obvious to expand the cooperative to accommodate more persons in challenging situations and giving hope to people had no hope of quick access to funding due to their status. This led to rapid increase in membership .

In 2020, the Covid year challenge gave rise to more loan requests from members than savings . So the Covid year birthed quick loans without collateral for members of the cooperative, we admitted others with side hussle in support of their day to day jobs and beneficiaries kept referring their fiends and relatives for quick value. The Covid year also birthed the introduction of Food, Housing and Lands contributions to enable easy access to food items at the end of the year, housing and land ownership with ease. 

In 2023, celebration of birthdays and milestone events of members was introduced where members were encouraged to contribute and celebrate themselves on their special days, connect with each other, socialize and travels. 

Presently we are progressing from mostly traditional practices to the warm embrace of technology and digitalization for significant impact on our members and stakeholders.`,
